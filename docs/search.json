    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\n\nWhat statistics, tournament information, and overall predictors are the best for predicting a potential upset?\n\nWe are no longer looking into upsets.\n\nDeveloping question (not fleshed out): Does the 2023 March Madness winner align with our model prediction? (Does our model’s predicted “most likely to be successful” teams align with the winner of March Madness?)\nNEW: What factors are the strongest predictors of success in March Madness?\n\nThese questions are important because March Madness is a pivotal and important part of the NCAA, and learning more about how to analyze the tournament through data science can foster the intersection between sports and technology. By answering them, we can learn more about what factors are important when predicting a winner. The questions themselves are not particularly original, but our insights can be valuable and unique. The target population is anyone interested in March Madness, the NCAA or NBA, or general basketball/sports enthusiasts.\n\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nFocusing on the first research question, our research topic is using the Tournament Team Data from 2008-2022 to try and figure out which predictor will be the best to predict success. Our hypothesis is that teams that score the most and give up the most points will do the best. In addition, we will look at previous upsets and analyze trends. Overall, however, we would need to play around with the dataset more before settling on a finalized hypothesis.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nThere are both categorical variables (e.g., Seed, Year, and Round) and quantitative variables (e.g., Points per Possession Offensive, Points per Possession Defensive, and Strength of Schedule). There are many variables in our dataset. Within our project, we will be testing the variables in our dataset to discover which variables are the strongest predictors."

    "title": "Predicting Success in March Madness",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Come March, each college basketball fan is focused on one goal: filling out the perfect March Madness bracket. They are trying to figure out which lower seeded teams are poised to make a surprise run and which higher seeded teams are not as good as advertised. Some have gotten close but still no bracket has been able to correctly predict all 63 games in a tournament. Even in the 2023 tournament, no websites reported a perfect bracket even after just the first day’s slate of games. We have all tried as well and have failed all the same.\nThe goal of our project is to answer the question: What factors are the strongest predictors of success in March Madness? Our hypothesis is that teams who are able to limit their turnover percentage while remaining high in KENPOM adjusted efficiency and BARTORVIK adjusted efficiency will be able to find success in the tournament. There are many other factors at play in a game of basketball, but these are the ones that we believe will be the most indicative of success.\nThe source of the data is from kaggle.com. However, because a lot of the datasets on kaggle.com are fake, we made sure to cross-check the data with official NCAA data on NCAA.com. We found that the dataset contains accurate information. The data from the dataset is pulled from https://kenpom.com/ and https://www.barttorvik.com/#. The data encompasses March Madness tournaments spanning from 2008 - 2023 (2020 not included). However, we will not be using the data for the 2023 March Madness tournament, as it is ongoing. Each observation in the dataset represents a team in that year’s tournament.\nRelevant variables:\nTurnover percentage: The percentage of a team’s possessions that end in a turnover before that team is able to attempt a shot on their own basket. A turnover is defined as a team losing possession to the other team during the course of play or due to an infraction of the rules. (Ken Pomeroy)\nKENPOM adjusted efficiency: Estimates how many points a team would outscore the average Division I basketball team by over the course of 100 possessions. (Ken Pomeroy)\nBARTTORVIK adjusted efficiency: Estimates how many points a team would outscore the average Division I basketball team by over the course of 100 possessions.
