Our hypothesis is that teams that score the most and give up the most points will do the best. In addition, we will look at previous upsets and analyze trends. Overall, however, we would need to play around with the dataset more before settling on a finalized hypothesis.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nThere are both categorical variables (e.g., Seed, Year, and Round) and quantitative variables (e.g., Points per Possession Offensive, Points per Possession Defensive, and Strength of Schedule)."

The article explores different statistical forecasting techniques and emphasizes the significance of elements like team performance measures, player statistics, and historical trends. The author also highlights the possible advantages of employing statistical models to choose brackets in a more informed manner, such as raising the likelihood of succeeding in office pools or online competitions.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nWhile the article discusses different metrics for statistical forecasting, we are 1). specific to predicting upsets rather than building a bracket, and 2). we use different variables."
